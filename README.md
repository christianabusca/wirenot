# 🎭 Wirenot Repository

> *"To wire, or not to wire? That is the question."* - Shakespeare, if he coded Verilog

## 🤔 What's This?

A collection of Verilog notes that went from handwritten chaos to digital clarity. Because sometimes you need to understand how electrons behave before you can tell them what to do.

## 📚 What's Inside?

- **`structural.md`** - Gate-level stuff. Like LEGO, but with AND gates.
- **`dataflow.md`** - Where `assign` reigns supreme and data flows like coffee on a Monday morning.
- **`behavioural.md`** - Teaching hardware to behave (spoiler: it involves `always` blocks and delays).
- **`testbench.md`** - How to interrogate your circuits to make sure they're not lying to you.

## 🚀 Who Is This For?

- Students cramming for Verilog exams at 2 AM ☕
- Anyone who's ever mixed up inter-statement and intra-statement delays
- People who think `reg` means "register" (it doesn't always!)
- Future hardware designers who currently think circuits are witchcraft

## 🎯 Goal

Turn "Wait, what's a testbench?" into "I can debug this with my eyes closed" (but please don't actually close your eyes).

## ⚠️ Warning

Side effects may include:
- Sudden understanding of HDL
- Uncontrollable urge to instantiate modules
- Ability to spot missing semicolons from across the room
- Dreams in Verilog syntax

## 📝 Note

These notes are based on actual handwritten materials. Yes, people still write things by hand. Yes, it's 2025. No, we're not judging.
